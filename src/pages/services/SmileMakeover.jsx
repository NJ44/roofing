            A complete smile makeover is a comprehensive cosmetic treatment plan that addresses multiple aspects of your smile to create a harmonious, balanced, and beautiful result. This personalized approach combines various cosmetic procedures including whitening, veneers, bonding, gum contouring, and sometimes orthodontic treatment to achieve your dream smile.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            The process begins with an in-depth consultation where we discuss your goals, examine your current smile, and use digital imaging to show you potential results. We consider factors such as your facial features, skin tone, lip shape, and personal preferences to design a smile that enhances your natural beauty.
