            When cavities or damage occur, our expert team provides high-quality dental fillings and restorations that restore both function and aesthetics. We use modern tooth-colored composite materials that blend seamlessly with your natural teeth, eliminating the need for unsightly metal fillings.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Our restoration process begins with careful removal of decayed or damaged tooth structure, followed by precise placement of the filling material that matches your tooth's natural color and translucency. We also offer ceramic inlays and onlays for larger restorations that provide superior durability and aesthetics.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            These custom-made restorations are fabricated in a dental laboratory and bonded to your tooth, offering a long-lasting solution that preserves more of your natural tooth structure. For severely damaged teeth, we provide dental crowns that completely cover and protect the tooth while restoring its natural appearance.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            All our restorative procedures are performed with attention to detail, ensuring proper bite alignment and comfortable function. We use local anesthesia to ensure your complete comfort throughout the procedure, and our modern techniques minimize discomfort and recovery time.
