            Dental veneers represent the gold standard in cosmetic dentistry for transforming smiles. These thin, custom-made shells are bonded to the front surface of your teeth, effectively covering imperfections such as chips, cracks, gaps, discoloration, or misalignment.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Made from high-quality porcelain or composite materials, veneers are designed to match the natural translucency and color of your teeth, creating a seamless, beautiful appearance that looks completely natural. The veneer process begins with a comprehensive consultation where we discuss your goals and examine your teeth to determine if veneers are the right solution for you.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            We then prepare your teeth by removing a small amount of enamel to make room for the veneers, take detailed impressions, and send them to a skilled dental laboratory where your custom veneers are crafted. During the fabrication period, temporary veneers protect your prepared teeth.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Once your permanent veneers are ready, we carefully bond them to your teeth using a strong adhesive, ensuring perfect fit and alignment. The result is a dramatically improved smile that can last for many years with proper care. Veneers are stain-resistant and durable, making them an excellent long-term investment in your smile's appearance.
